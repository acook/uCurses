this file contains a list of menu function vector tags. create
a file with tags for your own menu functions and copy it into 
the build directory and execute a make followed by 

	.libs/libuCurses.so menu_vectors

(assuming your file has the same name as this one).

The library will then produce the C code you will need to add 
to your application in order to integrate the meny functions 
specified in your json file.

Each menu item specified in your json file will have a name
which is displayed in the menus and a vector tag.  the
vector tags specified in your json must match the tags
you give here.  the functions should also share the same
name.

these are the tags currently used in the example program
but none of the menus there actually do mutch :)
